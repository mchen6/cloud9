Each Flash project that is used by Ajax.org Platform, may be compiled with a Flash
compiler like MTASC or the one bundled with the Flex SDK.

We recommend to always use the latest versions of the compiler, so that your SWF
files won't have issues running with the latest Flash runtimes.

You can download MTASC for Flash 8 projects at

You can download the Flex SDK from Adobe for Flash 9 and above at
